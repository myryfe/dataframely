## Usage

Using Dataframely is straightforward. Here‚Äôs a simple example to get you started:

```python
import polars as pl
from dataframely import validate

# Sample DataFrame
df = pl.DataFrame({
    "name": ["Alice", "Bob", "Charlie"],
    "age": [25, 30, None],
    "email": ["alice@example.com", "bob@example", "charlie@example.com"]
})

# Validation rules
rules = {
    "name": {"type": "str", "required": True},
    "age": {"type": "int", "min": 0},
    "email": {"type": "str", "email": True}
}

# Validate DataFrame
validation_result = validate(df, rules)

if validation_result.is_valid:
    print("DataFrame is valid!")
else:
    print("Validation errors:", validation_result.errors)
```

This example shows how to create a DataFrame, define validation rules, and validate the data. You can customize the rules based on your requirements.
